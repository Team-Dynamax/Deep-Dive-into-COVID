## ML Ops
This repository serves as an exploratory data analysis into the Coronavirus disease with <br />
a special focus on the Caribbean territories.<br /> <br />
It's 6:00 AM and I still haven't slept so imma do this later actually. Cheers.

The research I am basing this module off is mentioned in the Sources.

Please reply to the proposed components in the Project tab if you have<br /?
any suggestions.
