<p>Trinidad and Tobago recently saw an upsurge of COVID cases after a dormant period. The challenge in
this project is to use publicly available data to measure, compare, visualize and predict significant trends
in this data. It would be useful to compare with other global and regional countries and find trends that
may be useful to inform gov't policies. The use of PowerBI, Tableau or any other visualization
environment is a requirement. The goal of this project is therefore to find, using programmatically
methods, trends and/patterns in publicly available COVID-related data. Analytical methods include (but
are not limited to): data transformation and cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine
learning predictive approaches.
